Merhaba!</p>\n<p>I got my first QA job back in July, 2018, in an indie game development studio working on in-house project called Gloria Victis: Medieval MMORPG. A huge scale project with small budget and small studio, only ~10 people, based in Lublin, Poland.</p>\n<p>During my 3.5 year work there, I learnt a lot of things thanks to having access to the source code, often analysing how code behaves, so called <code class=\"language-text\">white-box testing</code>.</p>\n<p>But at one point I realized gaming industry is not my place, at least not full time. So I have decided to become a corpo-guy. Started working with serious clients, enterprise web applications. And this is where I, for the first time, started automating tests, using <code class=\"language-text\">Cypress</code>.</p>\n<p>It was very nice start! Later I started working in various projects, where I had a hybrid role: do any kind of testing. This is when I first had an opportunity to start using <code class=\"language-text\">Playwright</code>. And this was exactly what we call <code class=\"language-text\">love on first sight</code>.</p>\n<p>Later switching to full time QA Automation Engineer position, I had an opportunity to work on a test framework consisting of <code class=\"language-text\">Cucumber.js + Playwright</code>. That was a hell of an experience.</p>\n<p>After next 3.5 year work as corpo-guy, I again switched a job, where I continue my only normal relationship with <code class=\"language-text\">my beloved Playwright</code>. This is the time period when I more or less started this blog.</p>\n<p>And what about this blog? - <em>It will be for sharing my experience.</em></p>\n<p>How often? - <em>Regularly.</em></p>\n<p>What else? - <em>I like pitsa a lot.</em></p>\n<p>With ananas? - <em>Hell no.</em></p>\n<p>See you in another blog post :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World - let's meet!","date":"July 08, 2025","description":"Before we start, let me introduce myself."}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"5bb510b6-11f6-5728-948c-f5ae18939a3e","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2236502407","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
