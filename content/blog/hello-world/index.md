Hello there! Cześć! Merhaba!

I got my first QA job back in July, 2018, in an indie game development studio working on in-house project called Gloria Victis: Medieval MMORPG. A huge scale project with small budget and small studio, only ~10 people, based in Lublin, Poland. 

During my 3.5 year work there, I learnt a lot of things thanks to having access to the source code, often analysing how code behaves, so called `white-box testing`.

But at one point I realized gaming industry is not my place, at least not full time. So I have decided to become a corpo-guy. Started working with serious clients, enterprise web applications. And this is where I, for the first time, started automating tests, using `Cypress`.

It was very nice start! Later I started working in various projects, where I had a hybrid role: do any kind of testing. This is when I first had an opportunity to start using `Playwright`. And this was exactly what we call `love on first sight`.

Later switching to full time QA Automation Engineer position, I had an opportunity to work on a test framework consisting of `Cucumber.js + Playwright`. That was a hell of an experience. 

After next 3.5 year work as corpo-guy, I again switched a job, where I continue my only normal relationship with `my beloved Playwright`. This is the time period when I more or less started this blog.

And what about this blog? - *It will be for sharing my experience.*

How often? - *Regularly.*

What else? - *I like pitsa a lot.*

With ananas? - *Hell no.*

See you in another blog post :)
